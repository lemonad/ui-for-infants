 Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient.

 Pearson's $r$ summarizes the relationship between two
 variables that have a straight line or linear relationship
 with each other.

 If the two variables have a straight line relationship in
 the positive direction, then $r$ will be positive and
 considerably above $0$.

 If the linear relationship is in the negative direction, so
 that increases in one variable, are associated with decreases
 in the other, then $r < 0$.

 The possible values of $r$ range from $-1$ to $+1$, with
 values close to $0$ signifying little relationship between
 the two variables.

 $r = E((X_i - \mu_X)(Y_i - \mu_Y)) / (\sigma_X \sigma_Y)$,

 where $\sigma_X = \sqrt{\sum (X_i - \mu_X)^2}$.
