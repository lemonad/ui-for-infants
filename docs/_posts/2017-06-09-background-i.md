Hourcade et al. (2015) looked at videos on YouTube in order to investigate
the use of tablets by infants and toddlers. They found, amongst other things,
that before 12 months of age, most (but not all) infants struggled with the
user interfaces, often using both hands or multiple fingers rather than
single fingers and specific gestures like tap and swipe:

Now, this is no surprise. It takes time for children to develop precise
enough motor skills for how tablets touch-UIs are designed to be used.
But what if there were alternative user interfaces, designed specifically
for infants to use -- would they be able to use them then, and perhaps more
importantly, would they want to?

Visual development
------------------
Neonates (children less than four weeks old) can sometimes track objects
if they are large and move slowly. At this age they seem to rely on saccades
(rapid jumps between different fixation points in the same direction, usually
occuring several times per second).

From about six weeks though, a different eye movement, smooth pursuits,
improves and infants begin to track things moving in a smooth pattern.
At about five months, smooth pursuits reaches adult performance when it
comes to sinusoidally and horizontally moving targets.

So, what if we could design interfaces based on this ability instead of
touch?
