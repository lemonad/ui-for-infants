Hourcade et al. (2015) analyzed 208 videos on YouTube in order to assess
the use of tablets by infants and toddlers. They found, amongst other things,
that before 12 months of age, most (but not all) infants were using both
hands or multiple fingers rather than single fingers and specific gestures
like tap and swipe:

Now, this is no surprise. It takes time for children to develop precise
enough motor skills for how tablet touch-UIs are designed to be used. Some
apps for infants do try to work around it by encouraging full hand
interaction or the microphone but this comes with the cost of limiting the
fidelity and intentionality of the interaction. That is, if the expected
input is coarse and imprecise, you can't make too much out of it or risk
output appearing random to the user.

But what if we could design a user interface specifically for infants to use,
one that leveraged some other faculty or sense that develops earlier than
touch -- would infants be able to use it then, and perhaps more importantly,
would they want to?
