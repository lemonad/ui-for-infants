title:   "Frame rate of camera"

excerpt: "The 10.5\" iPad only has 30 fps modes for the front-facing facetime camera"

An interesting side-note is that the latest, 2nd generation, iPad Pro's (mid 2017) only support a maximum frame rate of 30 fps with the front-facing camera (see [table 4–21][1]) whereas the 1st generation iPad Pro's support up to 60 fps in most modes (cf. [table 4–26][2]).

It would be interesting to know the rationale for this step backward but I haven't been able to find anything online.
