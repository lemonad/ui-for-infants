* Apple iPad 10.5" (2017) for running the iOS app and providing real-time
  camera input,
* Swift, Objective-C and C++ for programming,
* Apple's SpriteKit for the UI,
* Apple's hardware-based AVCapture for face detection,
* Dlib for five-point face landmark detection (eye corners) and face
  alignment normalization,
* Pupil detection algorithm implemented from [Monsour...],
* [Pearson...] for calculating the correlation between pupil and sprite
  movements

Future enhancements
-------------------
There are a lot of features that I would like to see in the app, going
forward:

* Parents can take photos and use as moving objects for investigating what
images/things/people their child is drawn to,
* A "win" screen so the child is rewarded with a larger version of the
  image that won. Perhaps even another image.
* Small animations in the moving images, perhaps by slowly toggling between
  two-three photos.
* Randomized pairing of objects with a long-term score board, in our case,
  finally settling what we've always expected: our cats would win over us,
  the parents.
* Adjust for the head tilt angle by combining the corresponding proportion
  of horizontal and vertical pupil movement. That way, detection should be
  completely rotation invariant (although vertical smooth pursuits for infants
  take longer to develop than horizontal pursuits).
* Make the hearts move faster with more correlation. As it is now the
  hearts only move when average correlation over the last 30 frames is at
  least 0.7. I use correlation to control opacity for the hearts indicating
  that the user is following the moving objects and it is unexpected that
  the hearts are not moving

Also, since I can produce correlations in the vertical axis as well, it
would be fun to pursue the other sketch in my
[project specification](https://lemonad.github.io/ui-for-infants/assets/pdf/jonas-nockert-specification-20180525.pdf):
