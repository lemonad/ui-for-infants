Visually, the eye has a number of distinct features that are relevant to eye and pupil detection:

* white of the eye (*sclera*),
* inner and outer eye corners (*medial canthus* and *lateral canthus*),
* blue or brown area (*iris*) with the *pupil* in the center,
* horizontal and vertical size of the eye opening (*palpebral fissure*).
