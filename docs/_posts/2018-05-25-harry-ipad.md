At this age, his motor skills were not good enough for touch UI in general
but he immediately picked up how to use this specific application.

One thing I was not aware of when I wrote the project specification, is how
much infants want to use touch (fingers, hands) to explore things. Even if
they would be able to use a gaze-based UI, they might not accept a
hands-free interaction.
